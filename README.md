# Images-Gallary
**Image-Gallery** is a web app for uploading images to the cloud. It is built in **nodejs**. Images in this app can be stored on the cloud just like Google's Photos app. I have coded this project with some features. Anyone can register and after logging in it can upload images, and delete if not required. Only authorized users can view and delete their saved images.

Below are some of the modules used to feature the app.
> ```multer``` - to upload images.

> ```jsonwebtoken``` - Used to generate JWT token for token based authorization.

> ```bcryptjs``` - Used to store passwords as hashed passwords.

> ```ejs``` - used to render veiw template.

> ```express``` - used to managing backend server feature.

> ```express-ejs-layouts``` - to create common layout for all template views.

> ```express-session``` - to create a session for an authorized user.
